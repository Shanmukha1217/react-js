# My React Project

This project is a basic website about myself, built using React with a focus on utilizing `react-router-dom` for component routing. It follows best practices in React development.

Please kindly refrain from judging the project based on its design aesthetics and instead, take a moment to appreciate the functionality it offers.

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Use of Outlet

One of the notable features of this project is the use of the `Outlet` component provided by `react-router-dom`. This allows for changing the main content component without affecting the header and footer. This separation of concerns enhances code maintainability and reusability.

### 2. Use of Loader

In this project, a loader is implemented to fetch data while hovering over a link, instead of using the traditional `useEffect` approach. This design choice removes the delay in loading information when opening a component. It provides a smoother user experience and demonstrates efficient data loading strategies.

## Hidden Route

As a special feature, there's a hidden route available for exploration. You can access it using the following URL format: `/user/{username}`, where `{username}` should be replaced with your GitHub username. Feel free to explore and interact with this route—it's a little touch of ❤️ for you as the user of this project.

Don't hesitate to play around with this route and see how it works.

**Note**: The success of any React project lies in its structure, maintainability, and user experience. This project showcases the use of `react-router-dom`, separation of concerns using `Outlet`, and an efficient loading strategy with a loader. Feel free to explore the [demo](https://my-site-ds.netlify.app) to see these concepts in action.
